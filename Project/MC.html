      <p><strong>McCormack Hall is one of the older buildings of UMass Boston.
        This building is another common building to have your classes in.
        McCormack is just like Wheatley, another building you go to for classes.
        However, you will also find some offices here as well. One office you
        will find here is the AASSP office on the third level. McCormack Hall
        is conveniently placed by Healey Libray and Wheatley Hall for easy
        access.</strong></p>
