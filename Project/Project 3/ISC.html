      <p><strong>The Integrated Science Complex is probably the best looking
        building on campus. Here, people conduct research and labs. If you're a
        student who takes classes such as Biology or Chemistry, you can expect
        your labs to take place here. There's also a Starbucks here, so if you
        feel hungry, thirsty, or both, you have easy access here. This building
        is often quiet and has nice places to sit and do work.</strong></p>
