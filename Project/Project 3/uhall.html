      <p><strong>Univeristy Hall is another one of the newer buildings. This is
        one of the more popular buildings to be in. Due to its nice design and
        classes, many students find it enjoyable to have classes here. Here in
        University Hall otherwise known as "U-Hall," there is an open area to
        study, and also a food court. Located on the second floor, the food
        court is a great place to eat at when you are hungry.</strong></p>
